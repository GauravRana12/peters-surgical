# Peter Surgical React App

Welcome to the Peter Surgical React application! This README provides instructions on how to pull the repository and run the code locally.

## Project Overview

This project is built using React, Redux, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Chakra-UI, Chart.js, and includes table components.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm (Node Package Manager): npm is included with Node.js installation.

### Clone the Repository

git clone [repository-url]
cd [project-directory]
Install Dependencies
bash
Copy code
npm install
Running the Application
Development Mode
bash
Copy code
npm start
This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser. The app will automatically reload if you make changes to the source code.

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

Production Build
bash
Copy code
npm run build
This command builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
